# TwitterSentimentAnalysis

## Description

This project utilizes Machine Learning to understand the sentiment of the President's tweets from the POTUS Twitter Account. By utilizing the Twitter API, Tweepy, tweets were pulled from the official Twitter account of the President. From there, the tweets were pushed into a Pandas dataframe in order to ensure ease of manipulation of the data. The tweets were then cleaned, removing retweet symbols, websites, URLs, numbers, and any other characters that would not affect the sentiment of tweets. This included English stopwords, which were removed thanks to nltk's stopword library. From there, a sentiment polarity function was applied to the tweets, and the tweets were assigned a label based on their polarity. The tweets were then prepared for Machine Learning by tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing the words in the tweet to prepare them for the model. Additionally, a TF-IDF vectorization transformation was applied, to assign values to words based on their importance in a tweet, and between all tweets. Then, the tweets were split into training and testing data, and were fit to a Linear Support Vector Classifier. From this point, the accuracy and f1 score of the model could be displayed.
